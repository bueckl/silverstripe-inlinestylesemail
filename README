Troubleshooting / known issues:
 * if you get strange characters, you might need to encode or decode to utf-8
 * apparently you can't have multiple selectors of native html elements eg: h1{} .. later ... h1{} the second will get ignored.
 
 
TODO:
 * allow modifying styles into Content
 * get css from files
